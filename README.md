# Matrix Speech Intelligibility Test (MATLAB Application); MATRIX-GUI 

The MATRIX GUI is a MATLAB-based application designed to accurately estimate the Speech Recognition Threshold (SRT)
and the slope at 50% speech recognition in babble noise.
This program utilises adaptive level control for target speech and constant noise levels and supports up to 16 audio channels.
It is a valuable tool for audiometric research and comparing the performance of different hearing aid systems in cocktail party type scenarios.

# Prerequisites

MATLAB 2022 or later, MATLAB Audio Toolbox, MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

# Usage

Download and copy the MATRIX_GUI on your hard drive. Add the MATRIX_GUI folder and its subfolders to your Matlab path.
Launch the application by running the matrix_gui.m file.
